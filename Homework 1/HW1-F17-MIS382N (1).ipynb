    "Supply chain optimization (I). Sites selection for warehouses to minimize distribution costs (proximity to vendors, balanced against proximity to consumers). How many warehouses are needed, and what capacity each of them should have. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal data would be demographic\\orders data on both the vendors and nearby population. Amazon would need to know the order volume of nearby populations along with projected growth which would be a forecasting problem. Also Amazon would need to compare that to vendor/transportation data to see what the optimal placement of warehouses would be, and how much capacity they're likely to have. The results from this analysis would increase efficiency in delivery time, and an increase in margins by decrease the costs associated with transportation. \n",

    "Fake reviews detection. They still have tons of progress to make in this area: at least categorizing users would be a first step, so that buyers know what kind of user produced a specific review; then relevancy algorithms must be used to assess how relevant a review is for a specific product, knowing that most likes and stars assigned by users are biased - partly because most normal people don't have time or interest to write a review. Indeed, fake reviews is a lucrative business taking advantages of inefficiencies in platforms such as Amazon. The best solution is to remove user-generated reviews and replace them, for each product, by number of sales over the last 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data needed for this problem would be reviews on products, possibly, if available, data that turks have already went through on a sample data set that has fake reviews in it. This data would be used as a training set for a classification model that would learn to predict fake reviews. This model would look at the attributes of the real reviews and see if there are differences between the fake reviews and real reviews. Depending on how accurate the model is at detecting fake reviews, it would provide enormous value in parsing down the reviews which need inspection to see if they're fake or not. \n",

    "1) Use sklearn.linear_model.Lasso and sklearn.linear_model.Ridge classes to do a [5-fold cross validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/exercises/plot_cv_diabetes.html#example-exercises-plot-cv-diabetes-py) using sklearn's [KFold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.KFold.html). For the sweep of the regularization parameter, we will look at a grid of values ranging from $\\lambda = 10^{10}$ to $\\lambda = 10^{-2}$. In Python, you can consider this range of values as follows:\n",

    "      import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "      alphas =  10**np.linspace(10,-2,100)*0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "  Report the best chosen $\\lambda$ based on cross validation. The cross validation should happen on your training data using  average MSE as the scoring metric. (8pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Run ridge and lasso for all of the alphas specified above (on training data), and plot the coefficients learned for each of them - there should be one plot each for lasso and ridge, so a total of two plots; the plots for different features for a method should be on the same plot (e.g. Fig 6.6 of JW). What do you qualitatively observe when value of the regularization parameter is changed? (7pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Run least squares regression, ridge, and lasso on the training data. For ridge and lasso, use only the best regularization parameter. Report the prediction error (MSE) on the test data for each. (5pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Run lasso again with cross validation using [sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html). Set the cross validation parameters as follows:\n",

    "    LassoCV(alphas=None, cv=10, max_iter=10000)\n",

    "A regression model that includes \"interaction terms\" (i.e. quadratic terms of the form $x_ix_j$) as predictors in addition to the linear terms is clearly more general than a corresponding model that employs the same independent variables but only uses the linear terms. Outline two situations where the simpler (less general) model would be preferred to the more powerful model that includes interactive terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "1: If the data were fit perfectly by a linear approxamation adding interaction terms to the model would only increase the variance of the model, with no significant decrease in bias. An example might be years of education as an undergraduate and total amount paid in tuition. \n",
    "\n",
    "2: If the data were extermely noisy, adding more interaction terms might be just 'chasing noise'. An example might be predicting stock market prices. If you fit the data really well with a complicated model you will likley just be chasing the noise of the stock market and wont make good predictions out of sample. A much simplier model would be suffice to adequetly predict stock market prices, like yesterdays stock price. "
