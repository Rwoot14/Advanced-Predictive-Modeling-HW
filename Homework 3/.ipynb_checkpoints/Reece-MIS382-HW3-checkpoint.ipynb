Using stochastic gradient descent, derive the coefficent updates for all 4 coefficients of the model: $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2 $$ Hint: start from the cost function (Assume sum of squared error). If you write the math by hand, submit that as a separate file and make a reference to it in your notebook or include the image in your notebook.\n",
    "2. Write Python code for an SGD solution to the non-linear model $$ y = w_0 + w_1*x_1 + w_2*x_1*x_2 + w_3*x_2$$ Try to format similarly to scikit-learn's models. Your class should take as input the learning_rate, regularization_constant and number of epochs. The fit method must take as input X,y and a choice of update_rule as 'SGD' or 'adagrad' (Notes on implementation below). The _predict_ method takes an X value (optionally, an array of values). Use your new gradient descent regression to predict the data given in 'samples.csv', for 10 epochs, using learning rates: [.0001, .001, .01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100] and regularization constants in the range: [0,10,100] . Plot MSE and the $w$ parameters as a function of epoch count (10 epochs) for the best 2 combinations of learning_rate and regularization for both SGD and Adagrad. ie you should have 2 plots of MSE and parameter updates for SGD and adagrad each. Report the MSE at the end of 10 epochs for all 4 combinations.\n",

    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",

The mean salary and age of the people who do buy a TV is 15 and 30 respectively and that of those who don’t is 8.5 and 25. Assume that both classes of customers have the same covariance given by the Identity matrix. Further, your sales data suggests that only 1 in 3 people actually bought a TV in the last few years.
